This idea initially came to me when I was choosing a project for my Grad school. It is currently in Prototype phase.

Why this project?
------------------
My family live in Nepal, a Himalayan country sitting in the bed rocks of Mount Everest. In 2015, a 7.8 Richter scale earthquake claimed lives over 8000 in a single day. The trauma the residents in the country had to go though was unimaginable. Then there were abroad residents like me worried about our dear ones and their safety.
Studies have found that Earthquakes that hit at night are the most dangerous ones claiming 3-4 times more casualties than in day. This project aims to provide alert to the residents in a house as soon as the Earthquake hits. 

How it works?
--------------
When the device notices seismic activity of certain Richter scale:-
1. Device is triggered
2. Lights turn on
3. Alarm goes off
4. Automated text message is sent to the loved ones.
5. Safe Button - future plan is to add a button which the residents can press when they are safe. It triggers another automated messaging to the list of configured phones.

Implementation
---------------
Below are the things required for building this project.
1. Bredboard-1
2. Photon-1
3. Piezo Seismic sensor-1
4. RGB light-1
5. Piezo buzzer-1
6. Press button
6. Wires
7. Cell phone

Setup Instructions
-------------------
1. Find a stable area in the house (likely in the basement) where false vibrations are rare.
2. Choose a power supply, either direct power or batteries. Future plan is to include a connection to solar power.
3. Connect the device with a working internet connection. If internet connection is not available, the device still works but won't be able to communicate with other devices.
3. Signup to IFFT and link the account with Particle account.
4. You are all set!
